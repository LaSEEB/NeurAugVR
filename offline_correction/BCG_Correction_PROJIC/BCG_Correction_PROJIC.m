% BCG_Correction_PROJIC() - perform BCG artefact correction by removing the 
%                           contribution of the BCG-related ICs selected by 
%                           PROJIC in the back-reconstruction step of the EEG signal
% Usage:
%    >> [ PowerFreq, PowerFreq_bkg ] = BCG_Correction_PROJIC(dataset, ...
%       activations, mix_matrix, limits_ecg, filters, k_clusters, art_harm, harm_thr, ...
%       TR, win_hz, plt, nb_plts)
% 
% Inputs:
%   dataset     - input data structure with the following mandatory fields:
%                  1) data -> EEG signal (each row represent an EEG channel)
%                  2) ecg -> ECG signal (row vector)
%                  3) srate [double] -> sampling rate
%                  4) Kp -> R peak annotations
%                  5) Cne [cell] -> name of each EEG channel
%                  6) TR -> annotations defining the begining of each volume acquisition
%   activations - IC time-courses returned by a given ICA decomposition
%                 algorithm
%   mix_matrix  - mixing matrix returned by a given ICA decomposition algorithm
%                (typically, activations = mix_matrix * dataset.data)
%   limits_ecg  - upper and lower limits, in milliseconds, for epoching the BCG artefact 
%                 occurrences using the R peak annotations as triggers {[ lower_lim upper_lim ]} 
%   filters     - low and high cutoff values of the band-pass filtering of EEG data {[ low_cutoff high_cutoff ]}
%   k_clusters  - number of clusters (can be an array, and BCG correction
%                 will be performed for all number of clusters specified, upon IC
%                 selection using PROJIC.m)
%   art_harm    - number of cardiac frequency harmonics for BCG artefact correction evaluation {recommended = 5}
%   harm_thr    - threshold for inclusion of harmonics {recommended = 0.25; for higher variability across subjects and channels, the threshold should be lower}
%   TR          - repetition time of the fMRI acquisition [s]
%   win_hz      - window length for which the BCG artefact correction will be assessed (recommended = 0.065} [Hz]
%   plt         - 1/0 = do/don't display the results
%   nb_plts     - number of subplots within each plot for displaying the selected IC time-courses
%     
% Outputs:
%   PowerFreq [cell]     - BCG artefact correction quantification in terms of
%                          relative reduction of average spectral power within artefact
%                          representative windows. It has (k_clusters + 1) elements, the first
%                          representing this quantification before correction
%   PowerFreq_bkg [cell] - the same for PowerFreq, but storing the BCG 
%                          artefact correction quantification in terms of
%                          relative reduction of average spectral power within 
%                          physiological background representative windows
